/**
 *
 * @file trackle_utils_properties.h
 * @brief Datatypes and functions for working with properties. Read the full description to learn about properties
 *
 * There are two concepts when it comes to working with properties:
 *  - Properties;
 *  - Properties groups.
 *
 * Properties are variables that are periodically published to the cloud with their name (key).
 *
 * Properties groups are groups of properties that are published with the same time period.
 *
 * Only properties that are inside a group are published to the cloud.
 *
 * Properties groups are created as follows:
 *  1. Declare a variable of type \ref Trackle_PropGroupID_t;
 *  2. Assign the result of \ref Trackle_PropGroup_create to this variable;
 *  3. Repeat the steps from 1 to 2 for all the properties groups that must be created;
 *
 * Then, in order to create properties, one must follow these steps:
 *  1. Declare a variable of type \ref Trackle_PropID_t;
 *  2. Assign the result of \ref Trackle_Prop_create to this variable;
 *  3. Add the created property to one or more groups with \ref Trackle_PropGroup_addProp;
 *  4. Repeat the steps from 1 to 3 for all the properties that must be created;
 *  5. Call \ref Trackle_Props_startTask to start the properties task.
 *
 * Now, one can work with properties (update, read, etc.) by using the remaining functions exposed by this file.
