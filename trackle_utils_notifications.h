 * @brief Datatypes and functions for working with notifications. Read the full description to learn about notifications
 *
 * Notifications are a construct that allows to let the cloud know that an event has happened.
 *
 * Every notification is characterized by two elements:
 *  - A (human readable) name that identifies the notification;
 *  - An event name that will be displayed by the Trackle platform when the notification is received.
 *
 * Moreover, at runtime, every notification has:
 *  - A level, that is an unsigned int;
 *  - A value, that can be a signed or unsigned int, or a floating point.
 *
 * When the level of the notification changes, the event is published to the cloud, along with the actual value of the notification.
 * The value's purpose is to give some context about the cause that triggered the change of the notification's level.
 *
 * In order to create notifications, one must follow these steps:
 *  1. Declare a variable of type \ref Trackle_NotificationID_t;
 *  2. Assign the result of \ref Trackle_Notification_create to this variable;
 *  3. Repeat the steps from 1 to 2 for all the notifications that must be created;
 *  4. Call \ref Trackle_Notifications_startTask to start the notifications task.
 *
 * Now, one can work with notifications (update, read, etc.) by using the remaining functions exposed by this file.
