Properties are variables whose value is published on the cloud, and that can be changed from the cloud.

See ```trackle_utils_properties.h``` for functions to be used with properties.

## Notifications

Notifications are a mechanism to tell to the cloud that something happened, along with a numeric value to give some context.

See ```trackle_utils_notifications.h``` for functions to be used with notifications.
